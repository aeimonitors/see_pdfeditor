1. Project Overview

    Application: PDF Editor Advanced (Web)

    Objective: To provide a fast, powerful, and highly secure web-based PDF editor that rivals desktop applications.

    Core Principle: Security by Design. The architecture must prioritize user privacy by processing files directly in the browser, ensuring sensitive documents never need to be uploaded to a server in an unencrypted state.

    Target Audience: Professionals, enterprise users, and individuals handling sensitive documents (e.g., legal contracts, financial reports, medical records).

2. Core Architecture Philosophy: Client-Side First

To meet the "secure" requirement, the application will not use traditional server-side processing.

    Client-Side Processing: All PDF rendering, manipulation, and editing operations (text editing, redaction, merging) will be executed directly in the user's browser.

        Technology: This is achieved using a WebAssembly (WASM)-based PDF engine. The engine's code is downloaded to the client, which then performs all heavy lifting locally.

        Benefit: The user's raw PDF file never leaves their machine unless they explicitly choose to save it to our cloud storage. This is the single most important security feature.

    Zero-Knowledge Storage (Optional): When a user saves a document to our service, the file should be client-side encrypted (e.g., AES-256) before it is uploaded to cloud storage.

        Benefit: The server only stores an encrypted blob. We (the service providers) cannot read the user's file contents, even if our database is breached. The decryption key (derived from the user's password) remains with the user.

3. Functional Requirements (Features)

Tier 1: Core Editing (MVP)

    High-Fidelity Viewing: Render complex PDFs accurately with zoom, pan, and thumbnail navigation.

    Page Manipulation:

        Add blank pages

        Delete pages

        Reorder pages (drag-and-drop)

        Rotate pages

    Annotations & Markup:

        Highlight, underline, strikethrough text

        Add text comments

        Draw freehand (ink)

        Add shapes (rectangles, ovals, arrows, lines)

    Basic Text & Image Editing:

        Add new text boxes

        Edit existing PDF text (with font/size/color matching)

        Add new images (PNG/JPEG)

    Export: Save/download the modified PDF.

Tier 2: Advanced Features

    Form Filling: Detect and fill interactive PDF forms (AcroForms).

    Form Creation: Add new form fields (text input, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns, signature fields).

    Digital & Electronic Signatures:

        Apply an electronic signature (draw, type, or upload image).

        Apply a cryptographically secure Digital Signature (using a certificate).

    Content Redaction: Securely and permanently remove sensitive text and images from a document (not just covering it with a black box).

    OCR (Optical Character Recognition): On-demand OCR to convert scanned images within a PDF into selectable and editable text.

Tier 3: Utility & Pro-Features

    Merge & Split:

        Combine multiple PDF documents into one.

        Split a single PDF into multiple files (by page range).

    Conversion:

        Export PDF to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Image (JPEG/PNG).

        Create PDF from Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Image.

    File Management:

        Cloud-based document dashboard (for users who log in).

        Local-only mode (for users who do not log in).

    Watermarking: Add/remove text or image watermarks.

    File Compression: Reduce PDF file size with quality options.

4. Non-Functional Requirements

    Security (Critical):

        No Server-Side Leakage: As defined in the architecture, no unencrypted document data should transit to the server for processing.

        Authentication: Secure user authentication using OAuth 2.0 / OIDC (e.g., "Sign in with Google/Microsoft") and/or passwordless email links.

        Data in Transit: All communication with the backend (for auth, storing encrypted blobs) must be over SSL/TLS (HTTPS).

        Data at Rest: All user-saved documents must be encrypted using AES-256 in cloud storage (ideally client-side encryption).

        Frontend Security: Implement strong Content Security Policy (CSP), XSS prevention, and CSRF protection.

    Performance:

        Fast Initial Load: The core viewer must load quickly. The WASM engine and advanced modules should be lazy-loaded as needed.

        Responsive Editing: All UI interactions (dragging, typing) must be real-time and fluid, without lag.

    Usability & Accessibility:

        The UI must be clean, intuitive, and responsive (work on desktop and tablet).

        Must comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards for accessibility.

    Compatibility:

        Must function on all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

5. Proposed Secure Tech Stack

This stack is optimized for client-side performance and security.

    Frontend:

        Framework: Next.js (React + TypeScript) for building the complex, stateful editor UI.
        Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
        State Management: React Query / TanStack Query

    Core PDF Engine (The "Brain"):

        A WebAssembly (WASM) SDK. This is the most critical choice.

        Options:

            Commercial (Recommended for "Advanced"): PDFTron Web SDK or PSPDFKit for Web. These are all-in-one, high-performance, and secure WASM-based solutions that provide all listed features (editing, forms, redaction, signatures) out of the box.

            Open Source (Harder): Combining libraries like PDF.js (for viewing) and pdf-lib.js (for manipulation). This is less "advanced" and requires significant R&D to build features like text-flow editing or redaction securely.

    Backend (For Auth & Encrypted Storage API):

        Framework: Python (FastAPI).

        Purpose: Only to handle user sessions and provide API endpoints to PUT and GET encrypted file blobs.

    Database (For User Metadata):

        Type: PostgreSQL.

        Purpose: Stores user sessions and metadata about encrypted files (e.g., filename, last modified date, storage path). Does not store file content.

    Authentication Service:

        next-auth (with FastAPI OIDC endpoints) or Auth.js, provide secure login from microsoft and social providers securely.
