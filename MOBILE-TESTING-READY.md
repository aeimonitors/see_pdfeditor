### Method 1: Using Your Local Network (EASIEST)

#### Step 1: Get Your Computer's IP Address

```powershell
ipconfig | Select-String -Pattern "IPv4"
```

Look for something like: `192.168.1.XXX`

#### Step 2: Make Sure Server is Running
```powershell
cd D:\Projects\see_pdfeditor\prototype
python -m http.server 5173
```

#### Step 3: Connect Mobile Device
1. Make sure your phone/tablet is on the **same WiFi** as your computer
2. Open browser on mobile device
3. Go to: `http://192.168.1.XXX:5173` (use your IP)
4. Test the app!

### Method 2: Using ngrok (PUBLIC URL)

#### Step 1: Install ngrok
1. Download from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/)
2. Extract and install

#### Step 2: Start Server
```powershell
cd D:\Projects\see_pdfeditor\prototype
python -m http.server 5173
```

#### Step 3: Create Public URL
```powershell
ngrok http 5173
```

You'll get a URL like: `https://abcd1234.ngrok.io`

#### Step 4: Test on Any Device
- Open the ngrok URL on any device
- Test from anywhere in the world!

### Method 3: Browser DevTools (QUICK TEST)

#### Chrome DevTools:
1. Press `F12`
2. Click device icon (or `Ctrl+Shift+M`)
3. Select device (iPhone, iPad, Galaxy, etc.)
