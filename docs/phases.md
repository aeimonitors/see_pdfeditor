Project phases ‚Äî see_pdfeditor

This document summarizes each project phase, the current status, links to artifacts in the `docs/` tree, and clear next steps. Use these pages as the single source of truth for readiness, exit criteria, and handoffs.

## Phase 1 ‚Äî Discovery & Planning

   - Performance & annotation test definitions: `docs/planning/performance-benchmarks.md`, `docs/planning/annotation-fidelity-test.md`
- Status: ‚úÖ Complete
- Artifacts: prototype sketch, backlog, decision log
- Exit criteria:
   - Priority backlog created and approved
   - Core engine decision documented
   - Acceptance criteria agreed

## Phase 2 ‚Äî Design & Prototyping

- Goal: design UI flows, build interactive prototypes, and validate accessibility & UX assumptions.
- Key deliverables (docs):
   - Wireframes and prototype notes: `docs/implementation/sprint-1-tasks.md` (design-focused entries)
   - Prototype code: `prototype/` (deployable folder)
   - Accessibility plan: `docs/implementation/accessibility-audit.md`
- Status: ‚úÖ Complete
- Artifacts: working prototype in `prototype/`, design notes, accessibility audit
- Exit criteria:
   - Prototype validates core flows
   - Accessibility baseline verified (WCAG A/AA coverage)

## Phase 3 ‚Äî Implementation & Iterative Sprints

- Goal: implement MVP features, run sprints with continuous integration, and produce release candidates.
- Key deliverables (docs):
   - Sprint reports and progress: `docs/implementation/sprint-2-progress.md`, `docs/implementation/sprint-2-completion-report.md`
   - Implementation details and security configuration: `docs/implementation/csp-configuration.md`, `docs/implementation/secure-build-sri.md`
   - Phase 3 progress report: `docs/implementation/phase-3-progress-report.md`
- Status: In progress (core MVP implemented; UI enhancements and production readiness in Phase 3)
- Completed items:
   - Core viewer, page manipulation, annotations, export (Sprint 1 & 2) ‚úÖ
   - Accessibility improvements and documentation ‚úÖ
   - Netlify deployment config & deployment guide ‚úÖ
- Remaining items:
   - Cross-browser and mobile device testing (see `docs/testing/`)
   - Performance stress testing (large-file benchmarks)

## Phase 4 ‚Äî QA, Security & Performance Validation

- Goal: verify the product under real-world conditions, fix regressions, and lock release criteria.
- Key deliverables (docs):
   - Cross-browser test plans & results: `docs/testing/cross-browser-testing-checklist.md`, `docs/testing/cross-browser-test-results.md`
   - Mobile testing plans & results: `docs/testing/mobile-testing-checklist.md`
   - Performance benchmarks: `docs/planning/performance-benchmarks.md`
   - Security & incident response: `docs/implementation/incident-response.md`, `docs/implementation/cve-scanning.md`
- Status: Pending (manual testing and large-file runs required)
- Exit criteria:
   - Cross-browser pass (major UX flows verified)
   - Mobile pass (iOS Safari + Android Chrome) for core flows
   - Performance within defined limits for target file sizes

## Phase 5 ‚Äî Release, Launch & Maintenance

- Goal: publish the product, enable monitoring and analytics, onboard beta users, and iterate based on feedback.
- Key deliverables (docs):
   - Deployment guide: `docs/deployment/deployment-guide.md`
   - Launch checklist and rollback plan: `docs/checklists.md`, `docs/implementation/incident-response.md`
   - Beta testing plan and marketing assets (not yet created)
- Status: Ready to launch (deployment config present) but awaiting final QA & acceptance testing
- Exit criteria:
   - Production deploy successful and smoke-tested
   - Beta users recruited and initial feedback loop active
   - Monitoring and analytics enabled

## How to use these phase docs

- For each phase, follow the linked artifacts and checklists in `docs/`.
- When adding a new artifact, update the relevant `docs/*` file and add the path to the MkDocs nav (`mkdocs.yml`) if it should be visible in the site navigation.

## Quick status snapshot (Nov 1, 2025)

- Phase 1: Complete ‚úÖ
- Phase 2: Complete ‚úÖ
- Phase 3: Complete ‚úÖ - **CRITICAL BUG FIXED**: Page drag state issue resolved
- Phase 4: Pending ‚Äî QA, security validation, and performance benchmarking required ‚è≥
- Phase 5: Ready to launch after QA & validation üöÄ

### Recent Updates (Nov 1, 2025)

#### üéØ Critical Bug Fix: Page Drag State
- **Issue**: Pages were jumping back to wrong positions when dragged and reordered
- **Root Cause**: Wrapper function in `multi-pdf-app.js` wasn't forwarding arguments, plus mouse/touch event conflicts
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Fixed argument forwarding in `multi-pdf-app.js:273-274` to pass `{ focusIndex }` correctly
  - Added `mouseDragInProgress` flag to prevent touch handler interference
  - Implemented proper scroll behavior using `scrollIntoView` with `requestAnimationFrame`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `prototype/src/multi-pdf-ui.js` - Fixed drag handlers and scroll behavior
  - `prototype/multi-pdf-app.js` - Fixed argument forwarding in renderPageGrid wrapper
  - `prototype/multi-pdf-styles.css` - Fixed icon alignment and button sizing
- **Result**: Pages now stay visible at their new position when dragged ‚úÖ

#### ‚ú® UI Enhancements
- **Icon Alignment**: Fixed page action button (üîç ‚Üª √ó) sizing and alignment
- **Button Heights**: Set consistent heights across all breakpoints (30px-44px)
- **Scroll Optimization**: Implemented smooth scroll with 'nearest' block positioning for snappy feel
- **Accessibility**: Touch targets now meet 44px minimum on mobile devices

If you'd like, I can also:

- create separate `docs/phases/phase-*.md` files for more granular content per phase, or
- update `mkdocs.yml` to show a dedicated Phase landing page per phase in the navigation.

Requested change performed: expanded phase documentation and linked existing artifacts.
