## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- **Performance:** Benchmarks validated; no optimization needed for MVP
- **Security Controls:** All documented; implementation straightforward
- **Technical Debt:** Prototype code clean; refactoring planned

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- **Timeline:** 6 weeks is aggressive; P1 features may slip
  - **Mitigation:** P0 scope locked; P1 features deferrable
- **Browser Compatibility:** Some APIs may not work in all browsers
  - **Mitigation:** Cross-browser testing in Sprint 3

### Managed Risks ✅
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Dependabot + weekly scans active
- **Code Quality:** ESLint configured; CI enforces linting
- **Documentation Gaps:** All implementation guides complete
