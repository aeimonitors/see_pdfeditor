2. Enhance prototype → production-grade MVP
3. Build CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and security checks
4. Deploy MVP to staging environment
5. Complete acceptance testing

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All P0 security controls implemented and verified
- [ ] MVP meets all acceptance criteria from `acceptance-tests.md`
- [ ] Performance benchmarks pass in production build
- [ ] Zero critical/high security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Staging deployment operational

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Jest/Vitest)
```javascript
// Test coverage targets
- Core PDF engine: 90%
- Annotation manager: 85%
- Page manipulation: 85%
- Export functionality: 80%
- Overall: 80%+
```

**Key Test Suites:**
- `pdf-engine.test.js` - PDF loading, parsing, metadata
- `annotation-manager.test.js` - Create, edit, delete annotations
- `page-reorder.test.js` - Drag-and-drop, array manipulation
- `pdf-exporter.test.js` - Export with annotations, page order

### Integration Tests (Playwright)
```javascript
// E2E test scenarios
- Load PDF and verify rendering
- Create annotations and export
- Reorder pages and export
- Large file warning triggers
- Keyboard navigation
```

### Performance Tests
```javascript
// Performance benchmarks (from Phase 1)
- Small PDF (150 pages): < 1s load + render
- Medium PDF (500 pages): < 3s load + render
- Memory usage: < 300 MB peak
- No memory leaks (10 consecutive loads)
```

### Security Tests
- CSP validation (no violations)
- SRI verification (tampered files rejected)
- Large file rejection (> 200 MB blocked)
- XSS attempt (malicious PDF metadata)

## Risk Mitigation (from Phase 1 Risk Register)

### Top Risks for Phase 2
1. **Performance regression** (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High)
   - Mitigation: Run benchmarks in CI; gate on performance thresholds

2. **Security vulnerability in dependencies** (Likelihood: High, Impact: High)
   - Mitigation: Dependabot alerts; weekly security scans; rapid patching process

3. **Browser compatibility issues** (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: Medium)
   - Mitigation: Cross-browser testing in CI; polyfills for older browsers

4. **Timeline slippage** (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: Medium)
   - Mitigation: Weekly sprint reviews; cut P1 features if needed; maintain P0 scope
