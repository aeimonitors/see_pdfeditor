## Performance Benchmark Results

### Small PDF (150 pages, 0.11 MB)
- **Load Time:** 202 ms ✅ (target: < 2000 ms)
- **Total Render Time:** 941 ms ✅ (target: < 3000 ms)
- **Memory Usage:** 54.73 MB ✅ (target: < 200 MB)

### Medium PDF (500 pages, 0.66 MB)
- **Load Time:** 694 ms ✅ (target: < 3000 ms)
- **Total Render Time:** 2127 ms ✅ (target: < 5000 ms)
- **Memory Usage:** 163.16 MB ✅ (target: < 300 MB)

**Conclusion:** pdf.js + pdf-lib prototype meets all performance targets. No performance blockers identified.

---

## Engine Decision: pdf.js + pdf-lib Hybrid

### Rationale
1. ✅ **Performance acceptable:** All benchmarks pass; load and render times within targets
2. ✅ **Security posture strong:** Open-source, auditable, no proprietary black boxes
3. ✅ **Cost-effective:** Zero licensing fees; no per-user/per-deployment costs
4. ✅ **Client-side native:** No server dependencies; runs entirely in browser
5. ⚠️ **Annotation limitation:** Flattened annotations (not editable after export)

### Trade-offs
- **Pro:** Fast, free, secure, open-source
- **Con:** Annotations are "permanent stamps" (not interactive)
- **Mitigation:** Document this limitation in UX; consider vendor SDK if editable annotations required post-MVP

### Vendor Evaluation Status
- Email templates ready for PDFTron and PSPDFKit
- Evaluation window: Nov 1-15, 2025 (if needed)
- **Recommendation:** Vendor evaluation is **optional** for MVP; can defer to Phase 2 if:
  - Flattened annotations are acceptable for initial users
  - No immediate need for advanced features (forms, signatures, redaction)
  - Cost optimization is a priority

   - Review security implementation docs
   - Decide: Proceed with vendor evaluation? (optional)

2. **MVP Scope Finalization**
   - Complete P0: MVP scope validation
   - Lock down Tier 1 feature set
   - Define out-of-scope items

3. **Implementation Planning**
   - Implement P0 security tasks (CSP, CVE scanning, large-file detection)
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline with security checks
   - Begin Phase 2 sprint planning

### Phase 2 Preparation
1. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Configure build pipeline with SRI
   - Implement CSP policies
   - Enable Dependabot and security scanning

2. **Feature Implementation**
   - Enhance prototype → production-ready MVP
   - Implement large-file detection UX
   - Add error handling and logging

3. **Testing & QA**
   - Write unit and integration tests
   - Perform accessibility audit
   - Run security penetration testing

### Vendor Evaluation (Optional)
If stakeholders decide to proceed with vendor evaluation:
1. Send outreach emails (Nov 1, 2025)
2. Schedule vendor calls
3. Obtain evaluation licenses
4. Run micro-spikes (Nov 1-15)
5. Complete scoring rubric
6. Make final decision (Nov 20, 2025)
