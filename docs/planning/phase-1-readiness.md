# Phase 1 Discovery & Planning — Readiness Checklist

This document consolidates the discovery artifacts and defines the exit criteria for Phase 1. Use it to track progress toward a Phase 1 completion review.

## Objectives
- Validate MVP scope against stakeholder needs and security constraints.
- Select (or shortlist) the core PDF engine with cost, capability, and security considerations.
- Produce the foundational planning assets: backlog, risk register, acceptance criteria, and compliance mapping.

## Deliverable Tracker

| Deliverable | Description | Source / Owner | Status |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| Prioritized backlog | See `docs/planning/backlog.md` for Phase 1 work items and priorities. | Product Manager | Drafted |
| Risk register | Live risk tracker with mitigation & contingency plans. | Program Manager | Drafted |
| MVP acceptance criteria | Ensure coverage of performance, accessibility, and security metrics. | QA Lead | Existing (`docs/acceptance-tests.md`) — needs update for perf/accessibility |
| Security threat model | STRIDE analysis of client-side PDF editor risks (`planning/security-threat-model.md`). | Security Engineer | In Progress |
| Security & compliance checklist | Map security checklist to SOC2 / GDPR obligations. | Security + Compliance | Not Started |
| Engine decision brief | Comparative analysis of WASM vendors vs open-source hybrid approach (`planning/engine-strategy.md`). | Engineering Lead | In Progress |
| Stakeholder interviews | Interview summaries and personas update. | UX Research | Planned |

## Exit Criteria
- ✅ Engine decision ratified or down-selected to two viable options with clear evaluation plan.
- ✅ MVP acceptance criteria updated with quantitative thresholds (render time, accessibility score).
- ✅ High-risk items have actionable mitigations logged in the backlog.
- ✅ Stakeholder sign-off on backlog priorities and project milestones.
- ✅ Compliance review confirms no blockers for local-only MVP release.

## Recommended Cadence
- **Weekly planning sync** to review backlog progress, risks, and decisions.
- **Architecture deep dive** with security before committing to a vendor SDK.
- **Stakeholder review** at end of Phase 1 to baseline the Phase 2 (Design & Prototyping) scope.

## Next Steps Toward Phase 2
1. Update acceptance criteria with performance and accessibility baselines.
2. Conduct engine evaluation spike and record findings in the decision brief.
3. Schedule user interviews and incorporate insights into UX requirements.
4. Confirm resource allocation for Sprint 1 (viewer & page management).
