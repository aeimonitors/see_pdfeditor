- [x] GitHub Pages deployment configured

## Phase 1 Exit Criteria

### Must-Have (Blockers)
- [x] **Engine decision made:** pdf.js + pdf-lib recommended ✅
- [x] **Performance validated:** All benchmarks pass ✅
- [x] **Security baseline:** Threat model + P0 security docs complete ✅
- [x] **Backlog prioritized:** P0/P1/P2/P3 tasks identified ✅

### Should-Have (Can Address in Phase 2)
- [ ] **MVP scope locked:** User stories validated with stakeholders
- [ ] **Vendor evaluation:** Optional (defer to Phase 2 if not critical)
- [ ] **Team staffing:** Real names assigned to backlog tasks

### Nice-to-Have (Deferrable)
- [ ] **User research:** Interviews with target users
- [ ] **Compliance mapping:** SOC2/GDPR checklist alignment
- [ ] **Roadmap draft:** 4-quarter feature roadmap

## Stakeholder Review Checklist

### Engine Decision Review
- [ ] Present pdf.js + pdf-lib recommendation
- [ ] Discuss annotation limitation (flattened vs. standard)
- [ ] Decide: Proceed with vendor evaluation? (optional)
- [ ] Get stakeholder sign-off on engine choice

### Security Review
- [ ] Review threat model and mitigation strategies
- [ ] Present P0 security implementation guides
- [ ] Discuss incident response process
- [ ] Assign security task owners

### Budget & Timeline Review
- [ ] Confirm Phase 2 timeline (implementation start date)
- [ ] Review vendor evaluation budget (if applicable)
- [ ] Discuss licensing cost avoidance (pdf.js = $0)

## Phase 2 Preparation

### Development Environment
- [ ] Implement CSP policies in prototype
- [ ] Set up Dependabot for CVE scanning
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline with security checks
- [ ] Generate and integrate SRI hashes for vendor assets

### Prototype → MVP Transition
- [ ] Refactor prototype code for production
- [ ] Implement large-file detection UX
- [ ] Add error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Write unit tests for core functionality

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update `setup.md` with production environment setup
- [ ] Expand `acceptance-tests.md` with test scenarios
- [ ] Document deployment process
- [ ] Create user-facing documentation (help guides)

## Optional: Vendor Evaluation Path

If stakeholders choose to evaluate vendor SDKs:

### Week 1 (Nov 1-7, 2025)
- [ ] Send outreach emails to PDFTron and PSPDFKit
- [ ] Schedule vendor calls
- [ ] Request evaluation licenses

### Week 2 (Nov 8-15, 2025)
- [ ] Obtain evaluation licenses
- [ ] Run micro-spikes (performance, annotations, integration)
- [ ] Populate vendor comparison tables

### Week 3 (Nov 16-20, 2025)
- [ ] Complete scoring rubric
- [ ] Update engine-strategy.md with findings
- [ ] Make final decision (Nov 20 deadline)

## Sign-Off

### Phase 1 Complete
- [ ] **Engineering Lead:** Engine decision approved
- [ ] **Security Engineer:** Threat model and mitigations reviewed
- [ ] **Product Manager:** MVP scope and backlog approved
- [ ] **Project Sponsor:** Phase 1 deliverables accepted

### Phase 2 Authorized
- [ ] **Funding approved:** Budget allocated for Phase 2 implementation
- [ ] **Timeline confirmed:** Phase 2 start date and milestones set
- [ ] **Team assigned:** Developers, QA, DevOps resources allocated
