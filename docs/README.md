see_pdfeditor — Documentation

This folder contains the developer and project documentation for the PDF Editor MVP prototype and planned roadmap.

Files:
- `phases.md` — Phase-by-phase plan and acceptance criteria.
- `setup.md` — Developer prerequisites and step-by-step local setup (Windows / PowerShell oriented).
- `checklists.md` — Security, QA, and release checklists.

Use these documents as the canonical starting point. For quick, hands-on testing, see the `prototype/` folder which contains a client-side prototype (no backend required).
