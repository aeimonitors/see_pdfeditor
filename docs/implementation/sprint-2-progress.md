## Risks and Mitigations

### Active Risks
1. **Undo/redo complexity** (Medium)
   - Mitigation: Implement incrementally, test each command type

2. **Memory with duplicates** (Low)
   - Mitigation: Use performance-monitor.js to track heap usage

3. **Annotation dragging UX** (Medium)
   - Mitigation: Test interaction patterns early, iterate on feel

### Resolved Risks
- None yet (Sprint 2 not started)

## Decisions Log

### Pre-Sprint Decisions
- **Decision:** Create app-refactored.js instead of modifying app.js
