# CVE Scanning Automation — P0 Task

This document outlines the implementation of automated dependency vulnerability scanning for the PDF editor project.

## Objectives
- Automatically scan JavaScript and Python dependencies for known vulnerabilities (CVEs)
- Integrate scanning into CI/CD pipeline
- Establish a process for reviewing and patching vulnerabilities
- Monitor pdf.js, pdf-lib, and other critical dependencies

## Current State
- Manual dependency management
- No automated CVE scanning
- Dependencies:
  - **JavaScript:** pdf.js, pdf-lib (CDN or vendor/)
  - **Python:** MkDocs, reportlab, pre-commit (dev dependencies)

## Proposed Solution: GitHub Dependabot

### Why Dependabot?
- Built into GitHub (no third-party service required)
- Automatic pull requests for security updates
- Supports both npm/package.json and pip/requirements.txt
- Free for public and private repositories

### Alternative: npm audit + GitHub Actions
- Run `npm audit` in CI workflow
- Fail build on high/critical vulnerabilities
- More control but requires custom scripting

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Enable Dependabot for Security Updates

**File:** `.github/dependabot.yml`

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  # Enable security updates for npm packages
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "security"

  # Enable security updates for Python packages
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "security"
```

### Step 2: Add npm Audit Check to CI

**File:** `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`

```yaml
name: Security Scan

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
  schedule:
    # Run weekly on Mondays at 9 AM UTC
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'

jobs:
  npm-audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run npm audit
        run: npm audit --audit-level=moderate
        continue-on-error: false

  python-safety-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'

      - name: Install safety
        run: pip install safety

      - name: Check Python dependencies
        run: safety check --file requirements.txt --json
        continue-on-error: true
```

### Step 3: Document Vulnerability Response Process

**Process:**
1. **Detection:** Dependabot or CI alerts about vulnerability
2. **Triage:** Engineering Lead reviews severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
3. **Action:**
   - **Critical/High:** Patch within 48 hours, emergency release if needed
   - **Medium:** Patch within 1 week, include in next release
   - **Low:** Schedule for next maintenance cycle
4. **Testing:** Verify fix doesn't break functionality
5. **Deployment:** Release updated packages
6. **Documentation:** Log in security incident register

### Step 4: Monitor Critical Dependencies

**Key Dependencies to Watch:**
- `pdfjs-dist` — Core PDF rendering engine
- `pdf-lib` — PDF manipulation library
- `mkdocs` — Documentation generator
- `reportlab` — Test PDF generator

**Monitoring Strategy:**
- Subscribe to GitHub security advisories for these repos
- Check [NPM advisories](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories) weekly
- Review [CVE database](https://cve.mitre.org/) for PDF-related vulnerabilities

## CVE Scanning Checklist

- [ ] `.github/dependabot.yml` created and committed
- [ ] Dependabot enabled in GitHub repository settings
- [ ] `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` created and tested
- [ ] npm audit passing in CI
- [ ] Python safety check configured
- [ ] Vulnerability response process documented
- [ ] Team trained on Dependabot PR review process
- [ ] Critical dependencies monitoring established

## Testing

After implementation:
1. Create a test branch with an outdated package
2. Push to GitHub and verify Dependabot creates PR
3. Trigger security-scan workflow manually
4. Verify alerts are visible in GitHub Security tab
