# Incident Response Playbook ‚Äî P0 Task

This document defines the incident response process for security vulnerabilities, data breaches, and critical production failures.

## Objectives
- Establish clear incident response procedures
- Define severity levels and escalation paths
- Document post-incident review process
- Ensure rapid mitigation of security threats

## Incident Severity Levels

### P0: Critical
- **Definition:** Complete service outage, active security breach, data exposure
- **Examples:** PDF viewer crashes on all PDFs, XSS exploit actively used, user data leaked
- **Response Time:** Immediate (< 15 minutes)
- **Escalation:** CTO, CEO, all hands

### P1: High
- **Definition:** Major functionality broken, security vulnerability reported, significant user impact
- **Examples:** Annotation save fails, CVE in dependency with exploit available, 50%+ users affected
- **Response Time:** < 1 hour
- **Escalation:** Engineering lead, product manager

### P2: Medium
- **Definition:** Non-critical bug, minor security issue, workaround available
- **Examples:** UI rendering glitch, outdated dependency with no known exploit
- **Response Time:** < 4 hours
- **Escalation:** On-call engineer

### P3: Low
- **Definition:** Cosmetic issue, feature request, minor performance degradation
- **Examples:** Typo in UI, slow render on 1000+ page PDFs
- **Response Time:** Next sprint
- **Escalation:** Backlog review

## Incident Response Workflow

### Phase 1: Detection & Triage (0-15 min)

**Detection Sources:**
- Automated monitoring alerts (GitHub Dependabot, npm audit)
- User reports (support tickets, GitHub issues)
- Security researcher disclosure
- Internal discovery during code review

**Triage Checklist:**
- [ ] Assess severity level (P0/P1/P2/P3)
- [ ] Verify reproducibility
- [ ] Identify affected systems/users
- [ ] Determine if actively exploited
- [ ] Create incident ticket (GitHub issue with `incident` label)

**Incident Ticket Template:**

```markdown
## Incident Report: [Brief Description]

**Severity:** P0 / P1 / P2 / P3
**Detected:** [Timestamp]
**Reporter:** [Name/Source]
**Status:** Investigating / Mitigating / Resolved

### Description
[What happened, what is broken]

### Impact
- **Users Affected:** [number/percentage]
- **Data Exposure:** Yes/No - [details]
- **Service Availability:** [percentage uptime]

### Timeline
- [HH:MM] Incident detected
- [HH:MM] Triage complete
- [HH:MM] Mitigation deployed
- [HH:MM] Incident resolved

### Root Cause
[TBD during investigation]

### Mitigation Steps
- [ ] Step 1
- [ ] Step 2

### Related Links
- CVE: [link]
- User report: [link]
```

### Phase 2: Containment & Mitigation (15 min - 4 hours)

**Immediate Actions (P0/P1):**

1. **Isolate Affected Systems**
   - Disable vulnerable feature via feature flag
   - Roll back to last known good deployment
   - Block malicious traffic at CDN/firewall

2. **Notify Stakeholders**
   - Internal: Engineering, product, support teams via Slack #incidents
   - External: Status page update, user email (if data breach)

3. **Deploy Hotfix**
   - Emergency PR with fast-track review
   - Skip non-critical CI checks if necessary
   - Deploy to production with monitoring

**Hotfix Deployment Process:**

```powershell
# Create hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/CVE-2024-XXXX main

# Make minimal fix
# ... edit files ...

# Commit and push
git commit -am "hotfix: patch CVE-2024-XXXX - [brief description]"
git push origin hotfix/CVE-2024-XXXX

# Create PR with [HOTFIX] prefix
# Request expedited review from 2 senior engineers
# Merge and deploy immediately after approval
```

**Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] Exploit no longer reproducible
- [ ] Automated tests pass
- [ ] Manual smoke test in production
- [ ] Monitoring shows normal behavior

### Phase 3: Investigation & Root Cause Analysis (1-7 days)

**RCA Template:**

```markdown
## Root Cause Analysis: [Incident Title]

**Incident Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**RCA Author:** [Name]
**Participants:** [Names]

### Summary
[2-3 sentence overview of what happened]

### Timeline
| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 14:00 | Dependency updated via Dependabot PR |
| 14:30 | CI passed, auto-merged |
| 15:00 | Deployment to production |
| 15:45 | User reported crash in Firefox |
| 16:00 | Incident declared (P1) |
| 16:15 | Root cause identified (pdf-lib 1.18.0 regression) |
| 16:30 | Hotfix deployed (rollback to 1.17.1) |
| 17:00 | Incident resolved |

### Root Cause
[Technical explanation of why the incident occurred]

**Example:**
> pdf-lib 1.18.0 introduced a breaking change in the `drawText()` API that caused annotation rendering to throw an exception. Our automated tests did not catch this because we lacked integration tests for annotation flattening in Firefox.

### Contributing Factors
- Lack of browser-specific integration tests
- Auto-merge enabled for dependency updates without manual review
- Insufficient pre-release testing of Dependabot PRs

### Impact
- **Duration:** 1 hour 15 minutes
- **Users Affected:** ~200 users (15% of active user base)
- **Revenue Impact:** None (free tier users only)
- **Data Loss:** None

### Prevention
- [ ] Add Firefox integration tests for annotation rendering
- [ ] Disable auto-merge for library updates (major/minor versions)
- [ ] Require manual QA approval for Dependabot PRs before merge
- [ ] Set up canary deployment (10% traffic) for 1 hour before full rollout

### Action Items
| Task | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| Add Firefox CI tests | @eng-lead | 2024-01-15 | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Update Dependabot config | @devops | 2024-01-10 | üîÑ In Progress |
| Write canary deployment runbook | @sre | 2024-01-20 | ‚è≥ Planned |
```

### Phase 4: Post-Incident Review (Within 1 week)

**Meeting Format:**
- **Attendees:** Incident responders, engineering leads, product manager
- **Duration:** 60 minutes
- **Agenda:**
  1. Timeline walkthrough (15 min)
  2. Root cause discussion (20 min)
  3. Prevention measures (20 min)
  4. Action item assignment (5 min)

**Post-Incident Review Checklist:**
- [ ] RCA document completed
- [ ] All action items assigned with due dates
- [ ] Stakeholders notified of resolution and prevention plan
- [ ] Incident retrospective scheduled (if P0/P1)
- [ ] Documentation updated with lessons learned
