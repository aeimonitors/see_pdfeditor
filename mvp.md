Here is a detailed elaboration of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) feature set, designed to deliver immediate, core value to the user while respecting the "secure, client-side" architecture.

The goal of this MVP is to create a complete and self-contained "markup and review" loop. The user must be able to open a document, perform the most common review tasks, make minor corrections, and securely save the file without ever needing a server.

1. üìÅ High-Fidelity Viewing & Navigation

This is the foundation of user trust. If the document doesn't look right, nothing else matters.

    Core Function: Reliably open and render PDF documents of varying complexity (including vector graphics, embedded fonts, and layered images) with 100% accuracy inside the browser.

    User Stories (As a user, I want to...)

        ...open a PDF from my local computer using a file picker.

        ...drag and drop a PDF file directly onto the web page to open it.

        ...zoom in and out of the document smoothly without text or images becoming blurry.

        ...pan and scroll through pages seamlessly.

        ...see a thumbnail preview of all pages in a side panel.

        ...click a thumbnail to instantly jump to that page.

2. üìÑ Page Manipulation

This covers basic document organization. Users frequently need to correct the structure of a file before sharing it.

    Core Function: Allow users to modify the order and composition of the document's pages.

    User Stories:

        ...see all my pages as thumbnails and drag-and-drop them to reorder the document.

        ...select one or more pages and delete them (e.g., removing a blank cover page or irrelevant appendices).

        ...rotate a single page (or all pages) in 90-degree increments (e.g., to fix a document that was scanned sideways).

        ...add a new blank page at any point in the document to insert new content.

3. ‚úçÔ∏è Annotations & Markup

This is the most critical feature set for an MVP editor. It addresses the primary use case of reviewing a document.

    Core Function: Provide a robust set of tools for marking up and commenting on the existing PDF content. All annotations must be saved as part of the PDF standard, so they are visible in other editors (like Adobe Acrobat).

    User Stories:

        Text Markup:

            ...select text and Highlight it (with color options).

            ...select text and Underline it.

            ...select text and Strikethrough it.

        Commenting:

            ...click anywhere on the page to drop a Comment Pin (or "sticky note").

            ...write and save text inside that comment.

            ...see all comments in a collapsible side panel.

        Shapes & Drawing:

            ...draw a Rectangle or Oval (e.g., to "box in" a section).

            ...draw a straight Line or Arrow to point to specific items.

            ...use a Freehand Pen/Ink tool to circle items or add a quick signature (as a drawing, not a cryptographic signature).

4. üìù Basic Content Editing

This is the feature that elevates the app from a simple "annotator" to an "editor." The MVP scope here is critical.

    Core Function: Allow for minor, "in-place" content additions and corrections. The MVP will not support full paragraph reflow (which is extremely complex).

    User Stories:

        ...click an "Add Text Box" tool, draw a box, and type new text onto the page.

        ...click an "Add Image" tool, upload a JPEG/PNG, and place it on the page (e.g., adding a logo).

        ...Edit existing PDF text to fix a single typo or change a date. The editor will attempt to match the existing font and size for this specific, in-line change.

5. üíæ Secure Export & Save

This completes the loop. The user's work must be saved securely and privately.

    Core Function: All editing is done in the browser's memory. The "save" function composites all changes (new page order, annotations, new text) into a new PDF file and provides it to the user.

    User Stories:

        ...click a "Download" or "Export" button at any time.

        ...receive a new PDF file downloaded directly to my computer.

        ...open this new file in any other PDF reader and see all my changes saved permanently.

        ...do all of this without ever creating an account or uploading my file to a server.
