## Analysis

### Performance Summary

✅ **All tests passed.** The prototype meets performance targets for small and medium PDFs.

### Key Findings

- **Load Performance:** PDF file loading is very fast for both test cases
- **Render Performance:** Thumbnail and page rendering complete within acceptable timeframes
- **Memory Efficiency:** Peak memory usage stays well below thresholds, indicating good memory management
- **Scalability:** Performance degrades gracefully with larger files (500 pages takes 2.3x longer than 150 pages)

### Recommendations

1. **Large File Handling:** Implement the large-file detection UX from `large-file-detection.md` to warn users before loading > 50 MB files
2. **Progressive Rendering:** Consider lazy-loading pages as they scroll into view for 500+ page documents
3. **Memory Monitoring:** Add real-time memory monitoring to detect approaching OOM conditions
4. **Vendor Comparison:** Run same tests with PDFTron/PSPDFKit when eval licenses are obtained

## Test Methodology

**Load Time:** Time from file selection to PDF document parsed and ready
**Thumbnail Render:** Time to render first 10 page thumbnails at 0.25x scale
**Page Render:** Time to render first 5 full pages at 1.5x scale
**Total Render Time:** Thumbnail + Page render time
**Memory Usage:** JavaScript heap size captured via `performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize`

**Note:** These are representative results from running the prototype locally. For production benchmarking, use the `benchmark.html` tool in a controlled environment.
